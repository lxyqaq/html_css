            <p>
                I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the last year,
                I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films.
                And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
