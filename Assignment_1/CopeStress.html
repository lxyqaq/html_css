                        It is normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared or
                        Talking to people you trust can help. Contact your

                        Limit worry and agitation by lessening the time you

                        coverage that you perceive as upsetting.

                        Sometimes, the best way to stop anxious thoughts is to walk away from the situation. Taking some
                        time to focus on your body and not your mind may help relieve your anxiety.
