                        Masks are a key measure to suppress the spread of COVID-19 and save lives.<br><br>
                        Wear a mask, especially when you can't physically distance, to limit the risk of getting
                        COVID-19.<br><br>
                        People wearing masks are protected from getting infected. Masks also prevent onward transmission
                        when worn by a person who is infected, whether they have symptoms or not.
